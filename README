# rainsorter

## Synopsis

rainsorter ranks each Metropolitan Statistical Area(MSA) in the United States by a metric called "Population Wetness" calculated for the month of May, 2015. Population Wetness is defined as the amount of rain received by an MSA during the daytime multiplied by the number of people living in that area.

## Data Sets

Data from three government published data sets is used by rainsorter to calculate population wetness:

Quality Controlled Local Climatological Data(QCLCD)

Description: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/qclcd/QCLCD?prior=N
Download: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/orders/qclcd/QCLCD201505.zip
Date: May 2015

QCLCD contains two data sets of interest:
  1. Hourly precipitation data for each weather station
  2. List of weather stations

GIS data describing the geographical area covered by each MSA.

## Definitions && Methodology

Metropolitan Statistical Areas

The United States is divided into geographic areas called Core Based Statistical Areas(CBSA). CBSAs can be either Metropolitan Statistical Areas(MSA) or Micropolitan Statistical Areas, of which this program concerns only the former. CBSAs(and therefore MSAs) are composed of counties and county equivalents.

MSAs are designated by a GEOID code. This 5-digit code appears in the Shapefile data as an attribute named 'CBSAFP', and in the census data as a field named 'Id2.' It may also be referred to as a CBSA code.

Geographic Description of MSAs

Geographical descriptions of MSAs are encoded in shapefiles. The shapefile contains both a geometric representation of the area covered by the MSA, as well as metadata from which we can extract the CBSA code and associate the geometry with the population estimate. We use the GeoTools(http://www.geotools.org) library to read shapefiles.

Weather Stations

Weather Stations are identified by a unique WBAN which is a 5-digit numerical code(may have leading 0s). The QCLCD weather station list also includes the longitude and latitude of each weather station. This location data can be used with the geographic description to associate a weather station with the MSA in which it is located.

Precipitation Data

Precipitation Data is broken down hourly and consists of: 

  1. WBAN to identify the station at which the reading was taken
  2. Inches of precipitation(trace amounts of precipitation <.005" are denoted as 'T')
  3. Hour recorded
  4. Optional flag denoting 'suspect' data

Population Wetness Calculation

Once all weather stations are associated with an MSA, the total amount of precipitation recorded by the station during the hours of 7am-12am is summed for the period
